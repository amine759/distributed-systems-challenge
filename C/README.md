```bash
rpcgen -a addition.x
```

Generate the following files:

Makefile.addition : This file is used to compile all client and server code

addition.h : Declare the variables and functions used

addition._xdr.c	: Encoding of non-standard data types 

calculator.clnt.c : The remote call proxy (proxying) is called by the local OS, and the call parameters arePackaged into a message, And then send this message to the server. Generated by rpcgen, programmers generally do not need to modify

addition_svc.c : Convert the request input through the network into a local procedure call, that is, it is responsible for decompressing the message received on the server and calling the actual server-side and application-level implementation. Generally, programmers do not need to modify

addition_client.c :	Skeleton client program, need to be modified by yourself

addition_server.c : Skeleton server program, need to be modified by yourself

Then run :

```bash
./addition_server
```

```bash
./addition_client 127.0.0.1
```
If you encounter a connection error when you run the server, you probably need to install or just enable rpcbind

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rpcbind
# or 
sudo apt-get install rpcbind
```
